# Horiseon-challange

## this project was an attempt to take Horiseon's webpage and refractor the HTML to make the webpage more accessable to people with disabilities with alt tags as well as adding semantic tags.

## I changed the title of the website as well as the containing file folder to allow for easier identification when attempting to look for the files locally/github.
